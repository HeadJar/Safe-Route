# Safe-Route
Safe-Route determines the safety of your walking path in New York City by the minute. 
By using years of crime data and machine learning, safe-route gives each block along your journey a safety rating, that is then aggregated to give a total safety score for your path so that you may know whether to walk ahead in peace or walk away and potentially live another day.
